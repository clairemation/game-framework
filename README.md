# game-framework

This very-much-in-progress game framework is written completely from scratch, using no open-source libraries, and is not currently open source. If you are looking for code to use in your game project, try Phaser.js, a popular, tried-and-true open-source game framework that is far more fully-featured than mine, and you will almost certainly have a better experience.
